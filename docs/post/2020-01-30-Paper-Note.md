Keeping track of papers is a really important part of academic life. 
I have been thinking a lot about how to find the right papers to read, how to read paper efficiently and also how to record my thoughts while reading the paper for future reference. Any of the above-mentioned questions is non-trivial, any minor improvement on it can make substantial benefit to your research.
I'll try to elaborate on the last part here.

## Granularity

There're two kinds of notes in terms of granularity you may take during reading a paper.

One goes into the very details. Researchers are usually very critical when reading other people's works. When they read the paper carefully, they may have comments about every sentence in the paper. I personally highlight interesting things, underline questionable things and randomly leave side comments. This kind of note grab the most part of the information from the paper but is relatively short term memory. After several days, you may have no idea about those highlighting and underlining. But that doesn't mean it's useless, it actually helps you understand the paper in the reading time and remind you something (even not everything) after that. Sometimes, people even write a review article or make slides (give a presentation), which can be also considered as detailed, low-level notes.

The other form of note records the high-level idea of the paper. It could be a brief summary of the paper, the biggest question you have when reading the paper, the impression the paper gives you. Some day, this note is the only memory you have about the paper. But I'd like to think it as a key to retrieve the past memory you buried deep in your mind.

While people take notes in order to maintain a long term memory, lots of us ends up keeping only low-level notes and overlook the importance of high-level notes.

## Category

Now that we have the note we took and want to keep it for the future. We certainly want it to be organized, but in what way? The fundamental idea of organizing the notes (or other information) is to exploit their structural properties and categorize them. Apparently we don't want to separate the note and its corresponding paper, thus organizing the notes you keep is organizing the papers you read.

Ordering files alphabetically can be certainly helpful when you have a great memory of the title of the paper you want to look up. This is the case if you a fan of hardcopy papers. To make my life easier, I only keep electronic ones and use a search tool on my computer.

Categorizing papers by the types of problems they were trying to address is an intuitive and powerful way. It's actually what libraries and book stores do to organize books. But design a type/class system is non-trivial if you want to consider the relationship between types.

Categorizing papers by the dates you read them is also useful. The underlying reason is that people usually read related papers within a certain period of time.
