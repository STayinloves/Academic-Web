> This article is a collection of some learning material for those who want to become a front-end developer. Although it should be useful for all beginners, it's mainly written to meet the require of a certain project I'm in. So it will focus on something I think useful.

## pre

What's happened when we surf the Internet?

*   Read the [answer](http://zhihu.com/question/22689579/answer/22318058) written by Zhang Qiuyi from [Alinode](https://alinode.aliyun.com/).
*   [20-Things-I-Learned-About-Browsers-and-the-Web](https://sxing.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20-Things-I-Learned-About-Browsers-and-the-Web.pdf) published by google.

## HTML/CSS

HTML and CSS are the foundations of web programming, you should grasp both of them deeply. Unlike any other programming language, they are very easy to learn from the beginning, but they are also profound in advanced learning.

*   [Mozilla's intro of HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/zh-CN/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Introduction)
*   [Mozilla's intro of CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/zh-CN/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Getting_started)
*   [Head First HTML/CSS](https://book.douban.com/subject/25752357/) This book is highly recommended by many people, but I think if you have already read the two items above, you can feel free to skip this and do some further reading.

*The most efficient way to learn things is to learn it from doing it, so I highly recommend you to have a try during reading on your computer or in [jsfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/) which is an awesome web IDE. If you come across problems, you should try to look for the answer in the documentation first and then search on the Internet, if you still can't find the answer, don't be nervous to [ask for help](https://lug.ustc.edu.cn/wiki/doc/smart-questions) on the Internet or just turn to me.

## Javascript

*   A [tutorial](http://www.liaoxuefeng.com/wiki/001434446689867b27157e896e74d51a89c25cc8b43bdb3000) was written by liaoxuefeng.
*   [Mozilla's intro of Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/zh-CN/docs/Web/JavaScript)
*   [JavaScript Secret Garden](http://bonsaiden.github.io/JavaScript-Garden/zh/), a collection of documentation about the most quirky parts of the JavaScript programming language, take a quick look to it.

### Vue.js

A [tutorial](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/23134551) was written by [Evan You](http://evanyou.me), who is the founder of Vue.js. Follow the **first and second parts**(the start and front-end environment) of this article and skip the third part for the moment.

## Tools

*   Editor recommended [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), read another [article](https://sxing.xyz/?p=111) I have written for why.
*   Documentation browser recommended [zeal](https://zealdocs.org/) in windows, and [dash](https://kapeli.com/dash) in macOS.
*   Chrome developer tool. [A1](http://zhihu.com/question/34682699/answer/81858413) [A2](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools)
*   Git
    *   A brief [view](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/index.zh.html) to git.
    *   A [tutorial](http://www.liaoxuefeng.com/wiki/0013739516305929606dd18361248578c67b8067c8c017b000) was written by liaoxuefeng.
    *   [GitHub git cheat sheet](https://services.github.com/on-demand/downloads/zh_CN/github-git-cheat-sheet/)
    *   _Advanced learning. [Git Pro](https://www.gitbook.com/book/0532/progit/details)_
    *   Coding.net offers a full-featured Linux [terminal](https://ide.coding.net) which supports git. (click the demo button and the terminal panel is in the lower part of the viewport) We may use [Coding](https://coding.net) as our git service, you should sign up and take a look of it.
*   Linux
    *   [vbird](https://book.douban.com/subject/4889838/)
    *   Also use the terminal offered in Coding.net's IDE to practice the use of Linux commands.

## Standard

*   [CodeGuide](http://alloyteam.github.io/CodeGuide/) was written by Tencent's [alloy team](http://www.alloyteam.com/).
*   Airbnb's [js style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)

## Further Reading

## Task

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">**Build a blog** by writing HTML, CSS and JS.</span> Feel free to use any front-end framework or open source projects as you want, but you need to tell me the reason why you should use that project. The blog should have some functions as followed:

*   contain several articles
*   support code highlight
*   support comment (can use third-party services like [Disqus](https://disqus.com) or [duoshuo](http://duoshuo.com/))
*   responsive, mobile supported

Examples:

*   [Evanyou's blog](http://evanyou.me/)
*   [Hux's blog](http://huangxuan.me/)
*   [Byvoid's blog](https://www.byvoid.com/)

The most important thing I think is to be elegant, wherever in code or design. And I recommend you to use vue.js to achieve some function.
