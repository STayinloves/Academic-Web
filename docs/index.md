## Bio

<img src="./img/uva.jpg" alt="img" id="myimg" style="float:right;border-radius: 0 12% 0 0;transition: width 0.5s;opacity: 0.8;">

I'm a first-year master student in computer science at the [University of Virginia](https://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/computer-science), where I work with Prof. [Yangfeng Ji](http://yangfengji.net) in natural language processing (NLP).

My long-term research interest lies primarily in helping computers to learn natural languages in the way humans do.
Language is the [conduit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conduit_metaphor) which bridges different forms of knowledge.
But, by itself, it doesn't necessarily contain sufficient information.
That's why I'm currently focusing on grounded language learning,
especially in finding intuitive algorithms to connect languages with various worlds.

I was lucky to be exposed to a few NLP research studies early at college.
For instance, I worked on domain adaptation for machine translation with Prof. [Xiaohui Ji](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/69798625_Xiaohui_Ji). 
And I spent nearly one year interned at the Microsoft Research Asia with the BotSys team (part of the BDM group or the [KC](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/knowledge-computing/) group) 
where I was working on [generic types entity recognition](https://github.com/Microsoft/Recognizers-Text) under the supervision of Dr. [Börje Karlsson](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/borjekar/) and [Guoxin Wang](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/guow/).
