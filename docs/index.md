## Bio

<img src="./img/uva.jpg" alt="img" id="myimg" style="float:right;border-radius: 0 12% 0 0;transition: width 0.5s;opacity: 0.8;">

I'm a first-year master student in computer science at the [University of Virginia](https://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/computer-science), where I work with Prof. [Yangfeng Ji](http://yangfengji.net).

My long-term research interests lie primarily in helping computers to learn natural languages like us human.
Currently, I focus on developing intuitive learning algorithms for grounded language learning and code generation (i.e. semantic parsing). I'm also interested also interpretable language representations.

Previously, I had experiences in a few natural language processing applications.
For instance, I have been working on domain adaptation for machine translation as my undergraduate dissertation with Prof. [Xiaohui Ji](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/69798625_Xiaohui_Ji). 
And I luckily interned twice at the Microsoft Research Asia in the BotSys team (formerly belongs to BDM group, now part of the [KC](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/knowledge-computing/) group) where I was working on [generic types entitiy recognition](https://github.com/Microsoft/Recognizers-Text) under the supervision of Dr. [Börje Karlsson](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/borjekar/) and [Guoxin Wang](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/guow/).
