## Bio

I'm an undergraduate student studying Computer Science at the [China University of Geosciences (Beijing)](http://www.cugb.edu.cn/EnglishWeb/index.html). 
I'll be joining the [UVa computer science department](https://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/computer-science) as a research master student this fall!

My long-term research interests lie primarily in helping computers to learn natural languages like us human. 
Currently, I focus on developing intuitive learning paradigms to guide machines with more informative feedbacks and interpretable language representations.

Previously, I had experiences in a few natural language processing applications.
For instance, I have been working on domain adaptation for machine translation as my undergraduate dissertation with Prof. [Xiaohui Ji](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/69798625_Xiaohui_Ji). 
And I luckily interned twice at the Microsoft Research Asia in the BotSys team (formerly belongs to BDM group, now part of the [KC](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/knowledge-computing/) group) where I was working on [generic types entitiy recognition](https://github.com/Microsoft/Recognizers-Text) under the supervision of Dr. [Börje Karlsson](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/borjekar/) and [Guoxin Wang](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/guow/).
